# qdyn
Program for N-dimensional numerical quantum propagation on a grid.

Compile with make
Recompie: make clean && make

Running ./qdyn with input.q file in the folder

Plotting with gnuplot:
./plot/plotND.sh
display output.gif 

TODO:
1) correct grid for 2D and 3D propagation
2) create test cases for 1D, 2D,and 3D HO and also one Morse potential
3) run test cases and verify the propagation
4) upload python analysis scripts
